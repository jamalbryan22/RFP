#### I was contacted by my insurance who told me that I needed to replace my roof in the next 12 months or I would get dropped from my homeowners insurance.
#### I started the process of soliciting quotes from roofing companies. I got about two in, and realized how inefficient and time-consuming the process was.
#### Searching companies in my area (there are a lot of them), getting in contact with them, providing my information. Then having to wait for someone to come out, physically look at the house, and finally
#### get a quote. Who has time for this? How do I make sure I get the best deal without speaking to almost every company in a 300-mile radius (maybe even more)?
#### I work a lot, and have a family to take care of that also demands time and attention. There has to be a more efficient way to do this.
#### Why can't I just throw the fact that I need a roof out to the universe and let the interested companies contact me with their best price, timeframes,
#### constraints, etc.? Maybe a company is doing a job in my area already and could cut me a nice deal if I go with them.
#### Why don't / can't we as individuals operate like companies and governments when it comes to getting work done by requesting proposals?
#### This leads us to the RFP (Request for Proposal) repo containing a frontend React-TypeScript and backend ASP.NET web application.
#### Best case scenario: this application revolutionizes customer and business relations and makes me a rich man. Or someone can just look at it and think I know a little bit about code and give me a job.
